# CASTLE
The code repository for ["Learning Classifier Synthesis for Generalized Few-shot Learning"]()

### Prerequisites

The following packages are required to run the scripts:

- [PyTorch-0.4 and torchvision](https://pytorch.org)

- Package [tensorboardX](https://github.com/lanpa/tensorboardX)

### Dataset

#### MiniImageNet Dataset

The MiniImageNet dataset is a subset of the ImageNet that includes a total number of 100 classes and 600 examples per class. We follow the [previous setup](https://github.com/twitter/meta-learning-lstm), and use 64 classes as SEEN categories, 16 and 20 as two sets of UNSEEN categories for model validation and evaluation respectively.
